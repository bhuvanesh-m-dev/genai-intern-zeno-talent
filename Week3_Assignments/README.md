# Week 3 – GenAI Internship Assignments

This folder contains all Week 3 assignments completed as part of my GenAI Internship under Zeno Talent.  
These exercises emphasize problem-solving, validation, error handling, file processing, NumPy usage, and API-based data analysis, which are essential skills for real-world GenAI and data-driven applications.

### ✔ Exercise 1: Age Calculator (20 points)
A Python program that:
- Accepts user birth date in `mm/dd/yyyy` format  
- Validates format and ensures a real calendar date  
- Calculates current age in years  
- Converts the date to European format (`dd/mm/yyyy`)  
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully with clear error messages  

### ✔ Exercise 2: Prime Number Generator (20 points)
A program that:
- Takes a start and end range as positive integers  
- Validates user input  
- Identifies all prime numbers in the range (inclusive)  
- Displays results formatted as 10 numbers per line  
- Handles invalid or non-numeric input safely  

### ✔ Exercise 3: Student Marks Processor (20 points)
A file-based data processing program that:
- Reads student data (registration number, exam marks, coursework marks)  
- Computes overall marks using predefined weightage  
- Assigns grades based on given grading rules  
- Creates a structured NumPy array  
- Sorts students by overall marks  
- Writes processed results to an output file  
- Displays grade statistics  
- Handles file, data, and computation errors gracefully  

### ✔ Exercise 4: Weather Data Fetcher & Analyzer (20 points)
An API-driven program using **OpenWeatherMap (Free Tier)** that:
- Fetches live weather data for a given city  
- Analyzes temperature and categorizes it as:
  - **Cold** (≤ 10°C)  
  - **Mild** (11–24°C)  
  - **Hot** (≥ 25°C)  
- Generates alerts for:
  - High wind speed (> 10 m/s)  
  - High humidity (> 80%)  
- Logs weather data to a CSV file  
- Handles API errors, invalid city names, and network issues gracefully

## 🔧 Technologies & Concepts Used
- Python (Core & Advanced)  
- Input validation & exception handling  
- File I/O (text & CSV)  
- NumPy structured arrays  
- API integration using `requests`  
- Real-world data processing logic  
- Clean output formatting  

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Week 3

Week 3 focuses on applying Python skills to real-world scenarios, including:
- Robust user input validation  
- Data analysis and transformation  
- External API integration  
- Error-tolerant program design  

These tasks directly support future GenAI use cases, such as dataset handling, intelligent agents, and AI-assisted decision systems.
