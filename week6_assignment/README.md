# Cosmic Linear Regression — Surface Temperature Prediction

This project implements a **Linear Regression model** using a cosmic environmental dataset to predict **Surface Temperature** based on planetary and atmospheric features. The objective is to understand how supervised regression models are trained, evaluated, and visualized using real numerical data.

The project is implemented as a **Google Colab (.ipynb)** notebook and demonstrates the complete ML workflow—from data loading to model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
