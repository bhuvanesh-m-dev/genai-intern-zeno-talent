# 🧠 GenAI Internship – Week 7  
## K-Means Clustering on Credit Card Customer Data

This week focuses on **unsupervised machine learning**, specifically **K-Means Clustering**, applied to a real-world financial dataset.  

The goal is to understand how clustering works without labeled data and how it can be used to **segment customers** based on behavioral patterns.

The entire implementation is done using **Python** in **Jupyter / Google Colab notebooks**, covering both theoretical understanding and practical visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Learning Type:** Unsupervised Machine Learning  
- **Algorithm Used:** K-Means Clustering  
- **Dataset:** Credit Card Customer Data  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Internship:** GenAI Internship – Zeno Talent  

---

## 🧠 Dataset Description

The dataset used is **CC GENERAL.csv**, sourced from Kaggle.  
It contains behavioral data of credit card customers, such as:

- Balance
- Purchases
- Cash Advance
- Credit Limit
- Payments
- Tenure
- Frequency-based spending patterns

These features help group customers into **meaningful clusters** based on their financial behavior.
