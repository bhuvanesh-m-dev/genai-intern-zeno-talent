# GenAI Internship – Zeno Talent

This repository contains my work and learning progress from the GenAI Internship at Zeno Talent, where I explore LLMs, prompt engineering, and practical Generative AI development. 

I am Bhuvanesh M, a 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student, passionate about AI, automation, and building real-world projects. I enjoy experimenting with GenAI, Linux, and modern software tools to improve my skills and create useful applications.

## What This Repo Includes

- GenAI tasks and assignments  
- Prompt engineering experiments  
- Model testing and output analysis  
- Small AI-driven projects and scripts  

## Purpose

To document my growth in Generative AI, showcase my work, and maintain a clean reference of everything I build during the internship.
